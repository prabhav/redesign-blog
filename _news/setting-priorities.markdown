intro: something is up
---

*December 4, 2019*

As I mentioned in the last post, I'll try to make my website an ongoing iterative effort. This should give me room to focus on the urgent things at hand, and keep pecking away at the others as I go.

*So what's important right now?*

I'm currently (embarrassingly) deep in the job hunt process, so the main focus right now is the portfolio bit:

- A nice way to present some selected projects
- Weave a story about the projects via case studies
- Brief personal introduction, and contact information

Next steps would be to quickly mock these things up, code them out, push it out to the world and keep tweaking and adding things in the background. Wish me luck!
